# NHLBI DataSTAGE Standards and Specifications

This repository holds STAGE-related standards and specifications for describing file formats and contents, data and metadata standards, and file-naming conventions.

These standards were developed within the context of the Data Harmonization Working Group, which is part of the DataSTAGE development team. 

This repository contains two types of standards:

1. Specifications, in JSON, for data exchange between different tools and services in the DataSTAGE harmonization workflow.
2. File-naming conventions for the different types of files generated within DataSTAGE.
